DSA2 is a class dedicated to understanding 
and implementing a multitude of algorithms. While
the first class was primarily focused on understanding/learning
the underlying data structures and the ways to implement
them, this class focuses on algorithms to solve problems, 
many of which utilize the previously
learned data structures through sorting, searching, and 
manipulating data within a structure.
So, algorithms. What are they? 
Well, it's a sequence of steps that are designed to accomplish a task. 
In the context of CS, this the task is most likely solving some type of issue.
Even a cooking recipe is an example of an algorithm! 

Within the class, you can classify algorithms based on 
the nature of how they operate. Below are the abstract paradigms and their descriptions:

Brute Force - algorithms that complete their task by executing/exhausting all possible actions
Incremental - algorithms that completes their task step by step, with each step generating 
an output closer and closer to your solution
Divide and Conquer - algorithms that complete their task by dividing the task into
independent smaller tasks, then combining their solutions
Dynamic Programming - algorithms that complete their task by breaking the task into
overlapping smaller tasks, then stores the solution for each small tasks to use later
Backtracking - algorithms that complete their task by exploring possible avenues,
then undoing choices based on if some value that determines if they're a bad choice
Randomized - algorithms that use randomness to improve efficiency
Approximation - algorithms that find the closest solution 


In addition to being a part of one of the behavorial paradigms above, algorithms can also
be classified into more specific categories based on what they accomplish or
what type of problem they're meant to solve. Below are the different categories of problems,
and some popular, specific problems belonging to them.

Sorting Problems - arrange elements in some specified manner
Traversal Problems - go through a structure based on specified criteria
Search Problems - find an object
Optimization Problems - Maximize or minimize some value
Mathematical Problems - perform number operations
Refactoring Problems - Refactor structures based on specified criteria 
Computational Geometry Problems - Solve problems involving geometric structures
Manipulation Problems - Manipulate certain patterns or objects on specified criteria
